This repository is used for my linear regression project for EECS 731. I will explore the NBA ELO dataset from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-carmelo to implement a linear regression model utilizing scikit-learn to predict the score of both teams in an NBA game. I will both use linear regression and random forest to predict the two team's score of the game
